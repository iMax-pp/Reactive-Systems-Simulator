== Pre-commit hook ==

Please, put those two files into .git/hooks/ before commiting any piece of code.
This hook is designed to prevent any breach of style before committing.

command-line:
$ cd Reactive-systems-Simulator
(Whatever it is.)
$ cp tools/* .git/hooks/
$ git commit ...

If a commit breaks the style, you won't be able to commit.
