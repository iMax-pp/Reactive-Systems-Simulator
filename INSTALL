RSS requires the Qt4 library, the Lua scripting language and QGLViewer library.

- QGLViewer can be retrieved from http://www.libqglviewer.com/
  A version >= 2.3 is required.

If you want to compile the sources:

$ qmake
(On Mac OS X, add "-spec macx-g++" to get a Makefile instead of a XCode project)

$ make

- Windows users, the Lua and QGLViewer libraries are already available in the 
lib/windows folder.
